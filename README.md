# Unbeatable-TicTacToe
Creating an Unbeatable AI for the game tic tac toe in C++.


For creating an unwinnable game of tic tac toe the minimax algorithm was used to control the computers AI.
Using the minimax algorithm the AI would look at every possible move and then play out the game to determine who would be the winner
based on that move. Each move would be assigned a value based on the winner from playing out the rest of the moves and then the 
computer would take the move that was rated the highest.
